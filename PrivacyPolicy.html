  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> Expense Tracker</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>Expense Tracker is an offline mobile application that helps you record and manage personal expenses. This app does <strong>not</strong> require user accounts or sign-in. It stores all expense data locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. Personal data we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect personal information (such as name, email, phone number) through the app.</strong> All expense entries, notes, and related data remain on your device only, unless you choose to export or share them yourself.</p>

  <h2>3. Usage data and analytics</h2>
  <p>To help improve the app and diagnose issues, Expense Tracker uses <strong>Firebase</strong> services (for example: Analytics and Crashlytics). Firebase may collect limited technical information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (for example: advertising identifier or instance ID)</li>
    <li>App version and operating system version</li>
    <li>Crash reports and performance data</li>
    <li>Basic usage events (e.g. feature usage counts, screen views)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These analytics are used in aggregate to improve the app’s stability and user experience. They are not used to build a personal profile of you or to identify you.</p>

  <h2>4. Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third‑party service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase</strong> — analytics and crash reporting. Firebase is provided by Google and operates under its own privacy policy. You can review Google’s privacy information at Google’s official privacy site.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Storage and retention</h2>
  <p>All expense data is stored locally on your device (for example, using local storage or the device’s database). Expense data remains on the device until you delete it or uninstall the app. We do not retain backups on servers or in the cloud.</p>

  <h2>6. No advertising</h2>
  <p>This version of Expense Tracker does not display ads and does not share data for advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>7. iCloud and external servers</h2>
  <p>The app does not use iCloud sync, external servers, or any other remote storage for user expense data.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Because the app does not collect personal information tied to your identity, there is limited personal data to access or delete. If you wish to remove your expense data, delete it from inside the app or uninstall the app which will remove local data stored on the device.</p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the data stored locally on the device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure — please treat your device securely (use device passcode/biometrics) to protect access to the app’s data.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will update the effective date shown at the top of the page.</p>
